== README

* A web application made by Trevor Truog and Jamie Hand with Ruby on Rails 4
for our final project for CS 701. (And for fun!) Middlebury College, Spring 2016.
* Made with lots of help from this tutorial at Lynda.com, by Kevin Skoglund:
http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

* imagemagick


TO RUN LOCALLY:

* have config/local_env.yml with the following in it:
  S3_BUCKET_NAME: 'yourbucketname'
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 'your_access_key_id'
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: 'your_secret_access_key'
  AWS_REGION: 'your_aws_region'
* run these from the root of the app:
  * (NOTE: Any time ```rake``` is used, you may need ```bin/rake```)
  * rake db:migrate (only needed if your database isn't up to date)
  * rake sunspot:solr:start
    * rake sunspot:reindex
      * do this any time after changing a "searchable" definition for a model
  * rails s


FOR DEPLOYING:

* heroku addons:create websolr
* add the following to the heroku config (see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3):
  $ heroku config:set S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
  $ heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
  $ heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
  $ heroku config:set AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
* add the following for static files to be served unless/until Apache or NGINX
takes care of it for us.
  $ heroku config:set RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true
* before committing and pushing to heroku:
  $ bin/rake assets:precompile
  * and be sure to point to static assets using AssetTagHelpers like image_tag,
    javascript_include_tag, and stylesheet_link_tag rather than putting them
    straight into the html with html tags! Something like the following will not
    work in production! :
    <!-- <img src="/assets/Middlebury_Panthers_logo.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:175px;height:75px;"> -->


TODO:

* confirm that user wants to leave the page if they've entered text w/o
  submitting a form and want to exit/go back/take a link away from the page
* make pages responsive (so they look nice on any size page)
* use sunspot (solr) to enable matching substrings in fulltext search
  * see https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/wiki/Matching-substrings-in-fulltext-search
* make it so a given user can't have two open sessions at once (i.e. be logged
  in in two places at once)
* in user 'show' view (i.e. user profile), grey out events in the past
* finish README (see suggestions below)

TODO FOR DEPLOYMENT:

* get solr working on heroku -- or switch to Bonsai with Elastic Search because
  websolr is $20/month minimum.
    * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19674619/heroku-rails-websolr-sunspot-is-not-free-in-production
    * https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/websolr#sunspot-for-ruby-on-rails
* Explicitly declare how to boot our server process via a Procfile.

BOILERPLATE NOTES/THINGS TO CONSIDER ADDING:

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
